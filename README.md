# DataFort Inc.
### We, DataFort Inc. are  presenting a solution to solve a major problem in the cybersecurity space.
>Our App provides a way to set up a scalable private- permissioned blockchain that helps us retain data integrity while counteracting the redundant nature of blockchains by using a local Interplanetary File System which works on the Proof of Authority consensus mechanism, keeping efficiency and speed at heart.

>We provide a seamless yet secure way for private and government enterprises to store large amounts of data while preventing unauthorized access/ modifications. We believe that this would be especially useful for law enforcement, banking and healthcare where malicious actors looking to modify data can bring about catastrophic consequences.
